## Pixel Sand Physics Drawer

This is a very small demo project made to see if I could replicate a similar physics sand simulation without the engine exploding. 
The demo here works well but is quite old code at this point and in dire need of a refactor. It's efficient enough for a fun play around demo however could certainly do with a new coat of paint and a clean up under the hood. 

The current build contains the following:

Tools for multiple items:
- Items include
- Eraser Tool
- Wall Tool

- Grass Tool (incomplete)

- Acid Tool
- Metal Tool (incomplete)

- Virus Tool
    
Reset button and FPS counter.
